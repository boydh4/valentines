        <p>Dear Maddy, I love you with everything in me. These past 7 months of knowing you has gone by in a flash and I am so glad to have met you. I cherish every single moment we have together and appreciate every little thing about you. Being able to treat you like the amazing person you are and see that smile on your face everyday is such a blessing. Through thick and thin, I know we both have each other's backs and will pick each other up when we need it. You're truly my best friend and I love you so so much. I've been waiting so patiently our whole relationship to finally ask you...</p>
